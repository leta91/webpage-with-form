# Fully Responsive Webpage with Form 

I created this repository using HTML, CSS and FontAwesome Icons

## Features:
- Web form (with checkboxes, radio buttons, input to insert URL and the button to submit all data)
- Favicon.ico image to display on all browsers on the browser tab next to the webpage <title>
- Arrow button to take users to the top of the viewport
